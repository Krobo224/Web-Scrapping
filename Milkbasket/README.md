### DETAILED STEPS FOR EXPTRACTING DATA FROM MILKBASKET

1) Understand the app: Studing the app's functionality, user interface, and the type of data we want to scrape. Familiarizing with the app's features and any potential limitations.

2) API analysis: Identifying the app's API endpoints and examine the requests made by the app to retrieve data. This may involve intercepting network traffic using tools like Wireshark or using a proxy server.

3) Reverse engineering: Reverse engineering the app's API endpoints to understand the structure of the requests and responses. Analyzing the data format (usually JSON or XML) and the parameters required for each request.

4) Authentication: Determining the authentication mechanism used by the app, such as API keys, tokens, or session cookies. Obtain the necessary credentials to authenticate requests.

5) Request data: Use a programming language (e.g., Python) and appropriate libraries (e.g., requests) to send HTTP requests to the app's API endpoints. Include the required parameters and authentication credentials in your requests.

6) Parse the responses: Receive the API responses and parse them to extract the desired data. This may involve working with JSON or XML parsing libraries, depending on the data format.

7) Iterate and paginate: If the app's API uses pagination to retrieve large datasets, implementing the necessary logic to iterate through multiple pages and fetch all the relevant data.

8) Data storage: Decide on the storage format for the extracted data. We can save it in a structured format like a database or export it to a file (e.g., CSV, JSON) for further analysis.

9) Handle rate limiting and throttling: Some apps may implement rate limiting or throttling mechanisms to prevent excessive scraping. Respect the app's API usage policies and implement appropriate delays between requests to avoid being blocked.

10) Error handling and logging: Implement error handling mechanisms to handle connection issues, API errors, or other potential problems. Additionally, logging the scraping process can help in troubleshooting or resuming the process if it's interrupted.

11) Ethical considerations: Before scraping an app, ensure that you're not violating any terms of service or legal restrictions. Always respect the app's policies and be mindful of the potential impact on the app's servers or other users.
